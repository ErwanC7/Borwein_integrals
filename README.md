# Borwein_integrals

This project consists to compute an integral n define by the user. To do this we have 3 methods, midpoint rule, trapazoid rule and simpson rule.
Then, when you finished to compute the integral n you have to display the difference between the integral n and pi/2.
Why ? Because the Borwein "theorie" was that integral was remarkable because of they were equals to pi/2
